Modal-native web framework for data apps, APIs, and more.

Some features of Hudson are;

* üêç **Async Python**: Hudson is 100% async. It's built on top of [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), [SQLModel](https://sqlmodel.tiangolo.com/), [Uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/), and [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev).
* ‚òÅÔ∏è **Modal**: Hudson uses [Modal](https://modal.com) for CI and deploys on [Modal](https://modal.com) by default. No need to worry about infrastructure, Kubernetes, or containers!
* üì® **Publish-subscribe** functionality built right in. Create any workflow you need with Hudson!
* ‚úçÔ∏è **Just write code!** No YAML necessary.

## What's Hudson?

Hudson is a framework for building web applications on Modal. Hudson is great for building APIs, data applications, MVC style apps, and messaging/ pub-sub workflows.

Hudson runs as a server-side application and provides a REST API for your application to communicate with. Hudson also provides a python client library that you can use to interact with the server.

## Installing Hudson

Hudson is available on PyPI. You can install it with pip:

```sh
pip install hudson
```
